## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Merge Considerations

### Build Warnings (Expected)
- MetaMask SDK async-storage warning (harmless)
- pino-pretty warning (harmless)
- These are development dependencies not needed in production

### Environment Variables Needed
Currently using default/mock values. For production:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKFLOW_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBSCRIPTION_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKFLOW_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
```

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Manual Testing** - Go through all major user flows
2. **Wallet Testing** - Test with multiple wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
3. **Network Testing** - Test on different networks
4. **Mobile Testing** - Test responsive design on mobile devices
5. **Performance Testing** - Check page load times
