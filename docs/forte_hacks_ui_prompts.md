FAQ CATEGORIES & CONTENT:

**üöÄ GETTING STARTED**

Q: What is ChainCron?
A: ChainCron is the first automation marketplace built on Flow blockchain. Think of it as "Zapier for DeFi" - you subscribe to pre-built workflows that automatically manage your crypto 24/7. Whether it's compounding yields, rebalancing portfolios, or setting price alerts, ChainCron handles it while you sleep.

[Expandable: "See how it works" ‚Üí Embedded video]

Q: Do I need to sign up?
A: No signup required to browse! You can explore all workflows, check performance metrics, and read reviews without connecting a wallet. When you're ready to subscribe, just connect your wallet - no email, no password, no forms. That's it!

[Visual: Simple diagram showing Browse ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Subscribe flow]

Q: How is this different from using a bot?
A: üéØ Key difference: Flow's Forte upgrade enables **native scheduled transactions**. This means:
- ‚úÖ No external servers or bots
- ‚úÖ Runs directly on blockchain (trustless)
- ‚úÖ Can't be shut down or paused
- ‚úÖ Transparent execution history
- ‚úÖ Lower costs (no middleman fees)

Traditional bots require trusted operators. ChainCron runs on Flow's protocol layer.

[Comparison table: ChainCron vs Traditional Bots]

**‚ö° FLOW & FORTE TECHNOLOGY**

Q: What are Flow Actions?
A: Flow Actions (FLIP-338) are like LEGO blocks for DeFi. Each Action is a reusable, composable building block that represents a specific operation (swap, stake, lend, etc.). 

ChainCron workflows combine multiple Actions into automated strategies. For example, our "Auto-Compound" workflow uses:
1. **HarvestAction** - Collect yield
2. **SwapAction** - Convert to desired token  
3. **StakeAction** - Reinvest back

[Interactive diagram showing Action composition]

Q: What are Scheduled Transactions?
A: Flow's native feature that lets smart contracts execute code at a future time WITHOUT needing an external trigger. 

Traditional blockchains need someone/something to call your contract. Flow can schedule: "Execute this workflow every 24 hours" and it happens automatically at the protocol level.

[Animation showing scheduled execution timeline]

Q: Why is Flow better for automation?
A: Flow was purpose-built for consumer apps. Benefits:
- üöÑ Fast (sub-second finality)
- üí∞ Low fees (cents, not dollars)
- üîí Secure (resource-oriented programming)
- ü§ù Composable (Actions + Cadence)
- üåê EVM compatible (works with Ethereum tools)

[Metrics comparison: Flow vs Ethereum vs Other L2s]

**üí∞ PRICING & PAYMENTS**

Q: What payment methods do you accept?
A: Primary: USDC (on Flow)
Also accepted: ETH, FORTE token
Coming soon: Credit card via Stripe

Why USDC first? It's stable, fast, and widely held by DeFi users.

Q: How does the free trial work?
A: 7 days, fully featured, no credit card required.
1. Connect wallet (any Web3 wallet)
2. Choose 1 workflow
3. Configure and activate
4. Trial starts immediately

After 7 days: Upgrade to Pro ($29/mo) or workflows pause. Your data stays safe - reactivate anytime.

Q: Can I get a refund?
A: Yes! 14-day money-back guarantee.
- Pro-rated refunds for monthly/annual plans
- Instant on-chain refunds (no waiting)
- No questions asked policy

[Button: "Request refund" ‚Üí Opens support chat]

**üé® FOR CREATORS**

Q: How do I become a workflow creator?
A: Simple 3-step process:
1. Build your workflow (use our Builder or code in Cadence)
2. Test on testnet (we help with this)
3. Submit for review (1-2 day approval)

Requirements:
- ‚úÖ Workflow must solve a real problem
- ‚úÖ Tested execution history
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation
- ‚úÖ Security review passed

[CTA: "Apply to be a creator"]

Q: How much can I earn?
A: Creators earn 80% of subscription fees.

Example: Your workflow costs $10/month
- 50 subscribers = $400/month to you
- 200 subscribers = $1,600/month
- Top creators earn $3K+/month

[Calculator widget: "Estimate your earnings"]

Q: What makes a successful workflow?
A: Top-performing workflows share:
1. üí° Solve specific pain (not generic)
2. üìä Proven track record (show results)
3. üìù Clear description (users understand it)
4. üéØ Optimized gas (lower costs)
5. üîÑ Regular updates (maintain quality)

[Case study: Featured creator interview]

**üîí SECURITY & PRIVACY**

Q: Is my crypto safe?
A: Absolutely. ChainCron is **non-custodial**:
- ‚úÖ You control your private keys
- ‚úÖ We never touch your funds
- ‚úÖ Smart contracts are audited
- ‚úÖ Permissions are granular (you approve each action)
- ‚úÖ Open source (verify yourself)

[Link to audit report]

Q: What data do you collect?
A: Minimal:
- On-chain: Wallet address, subscriptions, executions (public blockchain data)
- Off-chain (optional): Email for notifications

We DON'T collect:
- ‚ùå Personal information
- ‚ùå Browsing history
- ‚ùå Private keys
- ‚ùå Transaction details beyond what's on-chain
