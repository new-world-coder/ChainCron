## ðŸ“‹ Post-Merge Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Add `AUTOMATION_API_KEY` to production environment
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set
- [ ] Test API key authentication in production

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Verify all endpoints working in production
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (if needed)
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Configure rate limit alerts
- [ ] Monitor API usage metrics

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Consider migrating rate limiting to Redis (for distributed systems)
- [ ] Set up caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database queries if needed

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update main README.md with API usage
- [ ] Add API examples to documentation
- [ ] Update deployment guide if needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
