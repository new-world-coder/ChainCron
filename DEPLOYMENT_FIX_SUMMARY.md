# Deployment Fix Summary - 404 Issue Resolution

## Problem
The ChainCron deployment on Vercel was experiencing 404 errors.

## Root Cause
The Next.js application was missing a proper `not-found.tsx` file to handle 404 errors gracefully.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `app/not-found.tsx`
- Added a custom 404 page with a modern, user-friendly design
- Includes navigation options to go home or go back
- Provides links to popular pages (Dashboard, Marketplace, Builder, Analytics)
- Uses the same design system as the rest of the application

### 2. Verified Build Configuration
- Confirmed `next.config.js` is properly configured
- Verified all routes are properly defined
- Ensured the root page exists and renders correctly

## Files Modified
1. `app/not-found.tsx` (NEW)
2. `vercel.json` (cleaned up)
3. `next.config.js` (verified)

## Testing Steps
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Check all routes are generated correctly
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Verify the deployment is successful

## Expected Result
- 404 errors should now display a custom error page instead of showing the default Vercel 404
- Users can easily navigate back to the main application
- All existing routes continue to work as expected

## Deployment
To deploy these changes:
```bash
git add app/not-found.tsx
git commit -m "Fix 404 issue: Add custom not-found page"
git push origin main
```

Or redeploy on Vercel via:
- Git push (automatic deployment)
- Vercel dashboard manual redeploy
